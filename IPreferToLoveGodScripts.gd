# proposition of Book I, Proposition 48, gives the converse that builders use: If we

# Proof.
# Suppose we have right triangle ABC as in Figure 1.2.2 with right
# angle at C, and side lengths a, b, and c, opposite corners A, B and C, respectively.
# In the figure we have extended squares from each leg of the triangle, and labeled
# various corners. We have also constructed the line through C parallel to AD,
# and let L and M denote the points of intersection of this line with AB and DE,
# respectively. One can check that ∆KAB is congruent to ∆CAD. Moreover, the
# area of ∆KAB is one half the area of the square AH. This is the case because
# they have equal base (segment KA) and equal altitude (segment AC). By a
# similar argument, the area of ∆DAC is one half the area of the parallelogram
# AM . This means that square AH and parallelogram AM have equal areas, the
# value of which is b2 .
