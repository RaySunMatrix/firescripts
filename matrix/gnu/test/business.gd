# SECTION 1.2. A BRIEF HISTORY OF GEOMETRY
# has an angle sum far exceeding 180◦ . (By triangle, we mean three points on the
# surface, together with three paths of shortest distance between the points. We’ll
# discuss this more carefully later.)

# Consider the triangle formed by the north pole and two points on the equator
# in Figure 1.1.4. The angle at each point on the equator is 90◦ , so the total angle
# sum of the triangle exceeds 180◦ by the amount of the angle at the north pole.
# We conclude that a non-Euclidean geometry applies to the sphere on a global
# scale.

# Figure 1.1.4 A triangle on a sphere.
# In fact, there is a wonderful relationship between the topology (shape) of a
# surface, and the type of geometry that it inherits, and a primary goal of this book
