# 1.1 Introduction
# Imagine you are a two-dimensional being living in a two-dimensional universe.
# Mathematicians in this universe often represent its shape as an infinite plane,
# exactly like the xy-plane you’ve used as the canvas in your calculus courses.
# Your two-dimensional self has been taught in geometry that the angles of any
# triangle sum to 180◦ . You may have even constructed some triangles to check.
# Builders use the Pythagorean theorem to check whether two walls meet at right
# angles, and houses are sturdy.

# within the universe is finite, consider the possibility that the universe itself is finite.

# the bottom edge. In three dimensions one can physically achieve this identification,
# or gluing, of the edges. In particular, one can bend the rectangle to produce a
# cylinder, being careful to join only the top and bottom edges together, and not
# any other points. The left and right edges of the rectangle have now become the
# left and right circles of the cylinder, which themselves get identified, point by
# point. Bend the cylinder to achieve this second gluing, and one obtains a donut,
